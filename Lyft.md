# Byteboard Environment Walk-Through

## Let's walk-through the Byteboard IDE


&nbsp;

**The Terminal** can be opened/closed by clicking the <walkthrough-cloud-shell-icon></walkthrough-cloud-shell-icon> icon above this panel.

* If you are unfamiliar with the command line [here are some key Linux commands](http://www.informit.com/blogs/blog.aspx?uk=The-10-Most-Important-Linux-Commands).

**The Editor** can be opened/closed by clicking the <walkthrough-cloud-shell-editor-icon></walkthrough-cloud-shell-editor-icon> icon above this panel. The editor will auto-save any changes you make. Please take some time to familiarize yourself with the editor:  
1. Open the runner.py file in the editor-walkthrough folder. 
2. Hover over ``` MathStuff() ``` in the runner.py file. You should see the definition of the MathStuff Class appear. Hovering over functions, classes, and libraries allows you to view relevant documentation. 
3. Right click on ``` MathStuff() ```, and explore options like 
    * "Find all references" (search across files and edit inline)
    * "Go to definition" (open the file where item is defined)
    * "Peek definition" (show inline the place where item is defined)
4. From the menu, click View > Outline. This shows a full outline of the runner.py file for easy navigation.
5. Take a moment to explore a little more. There are several features this walk-through doesn't cover that you may find interesting.

*Other Tips:*
* If you would like to change the editor's color theme, go to File > Settings > Change Color Theme.
