count() 
  counts the number of occurences an element appears, list or string 
  parameter - element 
  output - number of occurences 
  0 if no occurences found 
  
Add to a string 
  result = ""
  result += "h"
  
Split Notation
  a[start:stop]  # items start through stop-1
  a[start:]      # items start through the rest of the array
  a[:stop]       # items from the beginning through stop-1
  a[:]           # a copy of the whole array

defaultdict 
  A container in the collections class of python, similiar to a dict but defaultdict already has a default value. We don't have
  to check for it
  
  Ex. from collections import defaultdict
    d = defaultdict(list)
    d['python'].append("awesome")
    d['something-else'].append("not relevant")
    d['python'].append("language")
    for i in d.items():
        print i

    This prints:

    ('python', ['awesome', 'language'])
    ('something-else', ['not relevant'])
    
 deque - collections.deque() 
   Preferred over list when we need a quicker append and pop from both ends of the list - O(1) 
    1. append() :- This function is used to insert the value in its argument to the right end of deque.
    2. appendleft() :- This function is used to insert the value in its argument to the left end of deque.
    3. pop() :- This function is used to delete an argument from the right end of deque.
    4. popleft() :- This function is used to delete an argument from the left end of deque.
    
s.reverse() 
  reverse the string in place
